🤖 AI/ML Approach

Instead of heavy ML training pipelines, lightweight heuristic and rule-based models were used to ensure real-time performance during the hackathon:

Surgery Duration Prediction: complexity-based regression formula

Schedule Optimization: greedy priority sorting

Equipment Failure Prediction: usage threshold alerts

These approaches are explainable, fast, and suitable for operational decision-making.
