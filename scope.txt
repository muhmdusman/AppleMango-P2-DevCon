Problem Statement 2: Hospital Operating Room 
Scheduler with Intelligent Conflict Resolution 
Overview 
Develop an intelligent OR scheduling system optimizing surgical facility utilization while 
managing complex medical constraints, staff availability, and emergency cases, balancing 
patient safety, resource optimization, and operational efficiency. 
Problem Context 
Hospitals face OR scheduling challenges with conflicting constraints: surgeon availability, 
equipment sterilization, emergency interruptions, staff fatigue, and patient priorities. Poor 
scheduling causes extended wait times, underutilized facilities, and staff burnout. 
Core Requirements (75 Points) 
1. Multi-Tenant Hospital Management Architecture (9 Points) 
Multi-tenant system supporting multiple hospitals/facilities. Each manages independent ORs 
(general, cardiac, neuro, orthopedic), surgical staff, equipment inventory, and patient queues. 
Role-based access: Hospital Admin, OR Manager, Surgeon, Scheduler, Nurse. Cross-facility 
resource sharing. 
2. Comprehensive Surgery Request Management (10 Points) 
Surgery request submission with patient demographics, procedure type, complexity level (1
5), priority classification (Emergency, Urgent, Elective), required surgeon specialization, 
equipment requirements, estimated duration, pre/post-op requirements, anesthesia type. 
Approval workflow and bulk import capability. 
3. Intelligent Constraint Satisfaction Scheduler (16 Points) 
Constraint satisfaction algorithm handling hard constraints (surgeon specialization match, OR 
capabilities match, equipment availability with sterilization, anesthesiologist availability, 
pre/post-op room availability, no surgeon >12 hours/24 hours, mandatory breaks, equipment 
sterilization cycles <3 hours apart) and soft constraints (minimize patient wait time, minimize 
OR idle time, preferred surgeon, batch similar procedures, minimize overtime, respect 
surgeon preferences). Real-time conflict detection, cascade rescheduling for emergencies, 
explanations for delays, optimality scoring. 
4. Priority Queue System with Dynamic Reordering (10 Points) 
Three-tier priority: Emergency (within 2 hours), Urgent (24-48 hours), Elective (within 30 
days). Automatic priority escalation based on wait time. Emergency override with automatic 
rescheduling. Fair bumping algorithm. Waitlist management. Visual priority queue dashboard 
with aging indicators.

5. Interactive Drag-and-Drop Calendar Interface (12 Points) 
Multi-OR Gantt chart timeline (15-minute increments, 24-hour view). Drag-and-drop surgery 
blocks with real-time conflict warnings (red), soft violations (yellow), automatic snap to valid 
slots, visual indicators for setup/surgery/cleanup. Color coding: green (scheduled), yellow 
(soft violations), red (hard violations), blue (emergency), grey (unavailable). Zoom/filter 
controls by surgeon, procedure, priority. 
6. Equipment & Resource Management (7 Points) 
Equipment inventory tracking with surgical instrument sets, sterilization status, specialized 
equipment, location tracking, sterilization cycle scheduling. Conflict detection when surgeries 
need same equipment. Automatic alternative suggestions. Maintenance scheduling with OR 
blocking. Utilization reports. 
7. Real-Time Notification & Alert System (5 Points) 
WebSocket real-time updates for new emergencies, schedule changes, equipment conflicts, 
staff availability changes. Email/SMS for surgery scheduled/rescheduled, pre-op instructions, 
reminders. In-app alert center for unresolved conflicts. Escalation alerts for overdue 
surgeries. 
8. Advanced Search, Filtering & Pagination (6 Points) 
Complex search across surgeries (patient name, procedure, surgeon, date range, priority), 
surgeons (specialization, availability, workload), equipment (type, availability, location), ORs 
(capabilities, availability). Multi-column sorting. Efficient pagination for 10,000+ records. 
Saved filter presets. CSV/Excel export. 
9. Biometric Authentication & Security (Required) 
WebAuthn implementation for passwordless login using fingerprint/face recognition. Support 
platform authenticators (Touch ID, Face ID, Windows Hello). FIDO2 compliance. Session 
management with JWT tokens. Audit trail for authentication attempts. 
10. Offline-First Medical Records Access (Required) 
IndexedDB implementation for offline patient data access. Sync when online using 
Background Sync API. Conflict resolution for offline edits. Encrypted local storage (Web 
Crypto API). Quota management for medical imaging files. 
AI/ML Integration (20 Points) 
1. Surgery Duration Prediction Model (12 Points) 
ML regression model predicting actual surgery duration based on procedure type/complexity, 
surgeon's historical performance, patient characteristics (age, BMI, comorbidities, ASA 
score), time of day (fatigue), day of week, scheduled duration. Use Random Forest/Gradient 
Boosting/Neural Network. Evaluation: MAE, RMSE. Feature importance analysis. Prediction

confidence intervals. Continuous learning from completed surgeries. Auto-fill predicted 
duration when scheduling. 
2. Schedule Optimization Recommender (5 Points) 
ML-based schedule quality scorer predicting disruption probability. Identify high-risk time 
slots. Suggest optimal surgery sequences. Pattern recognition from successful vs. problematic 
schedules. 
3. Equipment Failure Prediction (3 Points) 
Predictive maintenance based on usage history. Predict equipment failures before occurrence. 
Proactive maintenance scheduling. Reduce unexpected unavailability. 
Deployment & Production Readiness (5 Points) 
Live deployment with HIPAA-compliant hosting considerations. SSL/HTTPS with TLS 1.3. 
Database encryption (at rest and in transit). CORS configuration. Rate limiting. Automated 
daily backups. Monitoring dashboard (uptime, error rates, API response times). Load testing 
for 100+ concurrent users. Documentation. 
Data Resources (Free/Public) 
• Training data for ML: Use MIMIC-III Surgery dataset (free after registration) or 
create synthetic surgery records using medical procedure taxonomies 
• Medical procedures: Use ICD-10 procedure codes (free from CMS) 
• Equipment data: Create from standard OR equipment catalogs 
• Historical surgery data: Generate using medical data generators or Synthea Patient 
Generator 
• Surgeon/staff data: Use Faker.js with medical specializations
